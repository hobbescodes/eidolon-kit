# Common Workflows

There are a few common workflows that you will want to use when developing with the ponder application. Below is a quick overview of those.

:::info
**Quick Note:**

`ponder-env-d.ts` is what makes the zero-codegen type system possible. This file contains a module declaration for `"@/generated"` that exports types derived from `ponder.config.ts` and `ponder.schema.ts`.

:::warning
Occasionally, Ponder's dev server may make changes to `ponder-env.d.ts` after upgrading to a new version of `@ponder/core`. When this happens, remember to commit the changes into version control.

## Generating Files

The `generated` directory is where the auto-generated GraphQL schema file is stored (`schema.graphql`). This file is generated from the `codegen` script:

#### From the `apps/ponder` directory:

```zsh
bun codegen
```

#### From the root directory of the turborepo:

```zsh
bun --filter ponder codegen
```

:::tip
Typically, it is best practice to re-generate this file whenever you make changes to the `ponder.schema.ts` file. This ensures that the schema is always up-to-date.

## Testing the API

### GraphiQL

One feature of the ponder application (when using the `graphql` middleware) is the ability to run a [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) instance that can be used to test the API in isolation.

To run the GraphiQL instance, run the following command:

#### From the `apps/ponder` directory:

```zsh
bun dev
```

#### From the root directory of the turborepo:

```zsh
bun --filter ponder dev
```

This will start the GraphiQL instance on `http://localhost:42069/graphql`.
