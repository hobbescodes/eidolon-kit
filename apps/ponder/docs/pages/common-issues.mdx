# Common Issues

There are a few common issues that you might encounter when developing with the ponder application. Below is a quick overview of those and how to resolve them.

## Anvil node is not running

If you run into an issue where `Historical sync` is constantly in a `Waiting to start...` state, it is likely that the Anvil node is not running. To resolve this, in a separate terminal window, run the following from the root directory of the turborepo:

```zsh
bun anvil
```

## Contract(s) are not deployed

If your local anvil node is running, and you run into an error that includes the following message:

```
PM FATAL process Finished shutdown sequence, terminating (exit code 1)
```

It is likely that the contract(s) have not been deployed on the currently running instance of your anvil node. To resolve this, run the following from the root directory of the turborepo:

```zsh
bun contracts:deploy
```
